            <p>The issue of gender based violence has been an unresolved social phenomenon for years, 
            it is an elephant in the room that remains unremovable, it is a continuous struggle that seems so difficult to be overcome, 
            and mostly it affect the lives of  people in a way that their dignity and their rights are no longer considered as being important by the perpetrator. 
            <strong>Gender-based violence is the abuse, ill-treatment and violation of human rights based on their gender and being powerless, 
            unprotected and unable to defend themselves in the midst of the barbaric behaviors directed to them. </strong> 
            people are physically abused, raped, and killed by their opposite gender, 
            in this case these people become victims of gender based violence and this behavior can be done by society members, 
            relationship partners, friends, and family members, 
            meaning that it cannot only be done by strangers because it has been clear that these incidents occur between people who know each other.</p>
            <p> Also gender based violence does not only affect women but it also affect men too but it has been evident that the most affected are females, 
            which makes the focus to be on them even all the implemented strategies that have been put in place are created so as to protect the most vulnerable. 
            As much as this issue is happening all over the world and countries like South Africa being one of those facing this social issue, 
            this presentation <strong>seeks to specifically raise the manner in which gender based violence affects Phillippi residents in Cape Town,</strong>
            where these issues have been found to be occurring numerous times without any ways or successful interventions in which this can be prevented from happening. 
            Due some of the publicly reported cases it has been clear that gender based violence is perpetuated by power, 
            privilege, and most importantly lack of knowledge.</p>
